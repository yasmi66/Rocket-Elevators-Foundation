To ensure that everything is in order, you need to download ruby and rails version above, and also mysql and postreSQL. You can also download DBeaver community to have a good look on databases.

# Command to use

First, we use a lot of gem pluggins, so you need to type `bundle install` to download packages. It might not work because of previous tries, so you can try `bundle update`. 

Launch the server with : `rails s`or `rails server`.
After that go on `http://localhost:3000/`to see the result.

To check our databases and tables on the terminal you can go on the sql console with : `mysql -u root`.
To display databases type `SHOW DATABASES;`, and `USE <database_name>;` and now you just need to display the table you want with : `DESCRIBE <table_name>`.
